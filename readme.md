# Titanic: Machine learning from disaster

This is a data analysis performed on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.com. All the work was done using RStudio.

Around 60% of the work is focused on exploring the data, cleaning it and understanding the relations between the different features we have the outcome (“Survived”).

The remaining is building models, cross validating them and submitting the results to Kaggle for validation. We build a Random Forest model and compare its performance to a Logistical Regression model.
